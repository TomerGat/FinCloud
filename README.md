# FinCloud
Digital banking system that can be accessed through a web application.
Initially I developed a version that works with a client and server (unfinished version in client_server folder) in order to build intial versions of objects, classes and functions. I am currently developing a web app version (in web_app folder).

Web app version is operational.
To use project, clone FinCloud/web_app. To run locally without MongoDB connection credentials, set BACKUP_DATA_FLAG in Fincloud_finals.py (line 64) to False.
Currently working on setting up official domain.
